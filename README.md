# ConcertTicket NFTs

## Project Description

ConcertTicket NFTs is a revolutionary blockchain-based ticketing solution that combats scalping while ensuring artists receive fair compensation through built-in royalty mechanisms. Each concert ticket is minted as a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the Stacks blockchain, providing verifiable ownership, transparent pricing, and automatic royalty distribution.

The smart contract implements sophisticated anti-scalping measures by capping resale prices at 150% of the original ticket price, preventing excessive markup that typically plagues traditional ticketing systems. When tickets are resold, artists automatically receive royalties, creating a sustainable revenue stream that continues beyond the initial sale.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to transform the concert ticketing industry by creating a fair, transparent, and artist-friendly ecosystem. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Scalping**: Implement price caps and ownership tracking to prevent exploitative ticket reselling
- **Empower Artists**: Ensure creators receive ongoing compensation through automatic royalty distribution
- **Enhance Fan Experience**: Provide secure, verifiable ticket ownership with seamless transfer capabilities
- **Build Trust**: Create transparent pricing mechanisms that benefit all stakeholders
- **Foster Community**: Enable direct artist-to-fan relationships through blockchain technology

By leveraging blockchain technology, we're building a future where concert tickets are fairly priced, artists are properly compensated, and fans can enjoy live music without the frustration of inflated secondary market prices.
